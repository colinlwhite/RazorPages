# Razor Pages Application
This is an introductory overview of Razor Pages. 
This project covers how Razor Pages looks, runs and its most important features. 
Eventually, I will compare Razor Pages to ASP.NET Core's other four project types.

# Short Description
Razor Pages is the simplest project because it's one page with code that supports it.
The code that supports it has two-way binding. 
Razor Pages is a really quick way to create an application, keep the complexity to a minimum and keep an application easier to debug.
